# Mocking Mirror

ü§° Mirror mirror on the wall, who knows nothing about AI at all?

## Overview

This repository contains the public code for the EDJEovation Days 2024 hackathon project to create an AI solution that can comment on video of a user and provide them with feedback on their appearance, with a sarcastic twist. The project is called the Mocking Mirror.

This version of the project has been modified for public use and maintenance by myself. The original project was created by a team of Leading EDJE developers.

The solution for this hackathon includes:

üåê A React web client application for user interactivity and presentation.

üíú An ASP.NET Core Web API that processes an image and returns text and audio responses.

‚ú® Azure AI services for generative image-to-text and text-to-speech synthesis.

üõ†Ô∏è .NET Aspire for orchestration of the local development environment.
